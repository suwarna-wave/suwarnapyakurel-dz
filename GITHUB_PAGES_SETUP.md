# GitHub Pages Deployment Setup

## ‚úÖ What has been configured

1. **GitHub Actions Workflow**
   - Created a workflow file at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
   - Set up to use pnpm for dependency installation and building
   - Configured to build and deploy your site to GitHub Pages automatically

2. **Next.js Configuration**
   - `next.config.mjs` has been verified with proper configuration:
     - `output: 'export'` for static site generation
     - `trailingSlash: true` for better path handling in GitHub Pages
     - `basePath: '/suwarnapyakurel-dz'` and `assetPrefix: '/suwarnapyakurel-dz/'` for GitHub Pages URL structure
     - `images: { unoptimized: true }` for static image handling

3. **Asset Handling**
   - Added a utility function `getAssetPath()` in `lib/utils.ts` to handle paths for GitHub Pages
   - Updated image references in components to use this utility function

4. **Static Site Support**
   - Added `.nojekyll` file to prevent GitHub Pages from processing your site with Jekyll

5. **Documentation**
   - Updated `DEPLOYMENT.md` with clear instructions for GitHub Pages deployment

## üöÄ Next Steps to Go Live

1. **Push these changes to your GitHub repository**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Configure for GitHub Pages deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings**
   - Go to your GitHub repository page
   - Navigate to "Settings" ‚Üí "Pages"
   - Under "Build and deployment", select "GitHub Actions" as the source
   - GitHub will use the workflow we created to build and deploy your site

3. **Wait for deployment to complete**
   - The first deployment might take a few minutes
   - You can monitor progress in the "Actions" tab of your repository

4. **Visit your site**
   - Your site will be available at: `https://suwarna-wave.github.io/suwarnapyakurel-dz`
   - The URL follows the pattern: `https://{username}.github.io/{repository-name}`

## üîç Troubleshooting

- **Missing Images or CSS**: Check the browser console for path issues. Make sure all paths are using the `getAssetPath` utility.
- **404 Errors**: Ensure GitHub Pages is properly configured and the build completed successfully.
- **Custom Domain**: If you want to use a custom domain, configure it in GitHub repository settings ‚Üí Pages ‚Üí Custom domain.

## üìù Notes

- Any changes pushed to the `main` branch will automatically trigger a new deployment
- The site is completely static and can be hosted anywhere that serves static files
- The build process happens in GitHub Actions, so you don't need to build locally before pushing
